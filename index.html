        <h2>I have always loved design.</h2>
        <p>I have been doodling in the margins for as long as I can remember. My dad had me playing on computers from an early age, and for most of my life I have kept playing around with computers. I loved being able to find information on anything you could ever imagine on the internet. I’ve always been pretty good at identifying a problem, searching for a solution, and then implementing that solution. The day I commandeered the family laptop, to hide away collecting music all night in my room, was great. That laptop never made it back out from its hiding place beside my bed. One day, much later, I fell into a job building websites for insurance agents.</p>
        <p>I worked part time at a software company in Metro-Atlanta as a receptionist. One day, they decided to launch a website and marketing project, and I was asked to take over the website making part of that project. I had never build a website before in my life. With no experience, I have to admit I was pretty nervous. My Google-fu has been really well honed over the years, and I took full advantage of it. I have taught myself how to manipulate HTML and CSS, in conjunction with creating images with Photoshop and Illustrator, to make beautiful and useful websites. I have extensive knowledge of the Weebly platform, and am willing to put in the effort to learn any thing else needed for your project. To me, learning new things is half the fun of this job.</p>
